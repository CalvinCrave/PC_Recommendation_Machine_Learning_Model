This is the folder of my Bangkit Academy 2022 Capstone Project (Machine Learning)

This folder contains my code of Machine Learning Model from AIROBuild Project.

AIROBuild is an app that helps people to determine what kind of PC Specifications those people needs,
align with their behaviour and purpose of building the computer.

There are two categories:
1. Gaming
2. Non-Gaming (Standard PC for working or studying)

I'm using NLP or Natural Language Processing with DeepLearning Algorythm. 
You guys can access the dataset and also the model in this folder.
